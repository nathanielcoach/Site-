    <h2>Coaching is your purpose. The Gremlin just says it isn't.</h2>
    <p>Your Gremlin doesn't want you to be a coach. It doesn't want you to do anything. It doesn't want change. It wants you to stay exactly where you are and call it <span class="text-purple bold">"being realistic."</span></p>

    <p>That's the Gremlin talking. It always has a good reason. <span class="gremlin-text">Later is where coaching practices go to die.</span></p>
    <p>But you keep coming back to this. You keep thinking about it. You keep helping people in conversations and then not charging for it. You keep reading posts like this one.</p>
    <p>That's not a coincidence. That's you knowing what you want and being afraid to go get it.</p>
    <p class="standout">This is where you go get it.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<div class="container"><div class="divider-full"></div></div>

<!-- WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What This Actually Is</h2>
    <p>Coaches say they hate business and sales. They don't. They hate the approach. They hate the scripts and the funnels and the "overcome their objections" stuff. Take all that away and what's left? Talking to people you care about and offering to help. That's not sales. That's just being a person.</p>
    <p>But first — you have to stop coaching people before you're in a session. You're doing it at dinner. You're doing it in the DMs. You're doing it at the grocery store with someone who didn't ask. There's no container. There's no professionalism. You're not in your office. Nobody gave you permission. And then you wonder why it doesn't land. Coaching without a container isn't coaching. It's just unsolicited advice from someone who read a book.</p>
    <p class="standout">Save it for the session.</p>
    <p>And find the easiest way in. You don't have to cold message strangers. You don't have to build a funnel. The easiest path is the one that's already in front of you. The friend who keeps venting to you about the same thing. The coworker who said "I wish I had someone to talk to." The person who already asked for your help once and you didn't charge them. Start there.</p>
    <p>The kind of coaching you do is a path too. Stop picking a niche off a list. What do people already come to you for? What conversations do you keep having without trying? That's your coaching. You don't have to invent it. You just have to notice it.</p>
    <p>And your structure can be as simple as you need it to be. "I meet with people on Zoom for an hour. It's $200." That's a coaching practice. You don't need a website. You don't need a logo. You don't need a niche statement. You need a time, a price, and someone to say it to. We help you figure out all three.</p>
    <p>Six months with a group of coaches who all want the same thing: enough clients to stop panicking, a practice that doesn't make them want to nap, and people around them who understand what this job is like.</p>
    <p class="standout">It's six months because you need reps.</p>
    <p>Every day you take a small risk. Not a big one. Not "quit your job and go all in." A micro risk. Something scary enough to make your stomach flip but not so scary you won't do it. Message that person. Say what you do out loud. Ask one more question than you normally would. And then you'll notice something — the person you talked to was fine with it. They didn't run. They didn't judge you. They were fine. So tomorrow you take a slightly bigger risk. And the day after that. Six months of that and the stuff that used to terrify you is just normal.</p>
    <div class="big-quote-gold">What can I do today that's scary enough to grow but not so scary I won't do it?</div>
    <p>That's the daily question. And after six months of asking it, you're not just a better coach. You're more yourself around more people. You feel good about yourself. Not in a fake affirmation way. In a "I did something hard today and it went fine" way.</p>
    <p class="standout">This is supposed to be fun.</p>
    <div class="big-green">High engagement. Low attachment.</div>
    <p>Care about people. Be interested in them. Ask questions like you mean it. But stop white-knuckling the outcome. You can be all in on a conversation and completely detached from whether it turns into a client. That's the sweet spot. Most coaches are either checked out or desperate. We teach you the middle.</p>
    <p>Dumb assumptive questions are fun. That's when you guess something about somebody. It doesn't have to be right. It just has to be playful. You're on a connection call. They're telling you about their week. You say "Let me guess — you've been thinking about this since Tuesday and you almost cancelled this call three times."</p>
    <p>They laugh. "How did you know?" Now they're not nervous anymore. Now they're telling you what's really going on. Not the polished version. The real one. All because you guessed something dumb and got close enough to make them laugh. That's a micro risk. And nobody talks to people like that on these calls. Which is exactly why it works.</p>
    <p>And you need to get good at follow-through. Following up. Checking in. Staying in touch with people without it feeling weird. You get needy when you don't know what to say next. Fix that and everything gets lighter.</p>

<div class="container"><div class="divider-full"></div></div>

<!-- WHAT WE BELIEVE -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <p>Getting rid of the fear isn't the goal. Getting really good at going toward what you want — while the fear is still there — that's the goal. <span class="gremlin-text">The Gremlins want you to forget what you want. Their only strategy. Make you forget.</span> So you show up twice a month with people who won't let you forget. For six months.</p>
    <p class="big-quote-gold">Somebody has to go first. You. The coach.</p>
    <p>Confidence isn't faking it. Confidence is owning who you are. The confident coach is the one who doesn't care if they get attacked. Someone pushes back. Someone says "that's stupid." Someone tells you you're wrong in front of a group. And you're fine. Not because you don't feel it. Because you're not building your identity on whether everyone agrees with you. People can't connect with you if they think you're perfect. Let them see the mess. Let them see you. The mess is what makes you a good coach. Not the polish.</p>
    <p>Your clients are the guy at the barbecue who won't talk about how he's doing because he knows if he starts he'll cry. If you're also that guy, now it's just two people faking fine at each other.</p>
    <p>The more reserved you act, the more it hurts you. Playing small doesn't protect you. It just makes everything harder and heavier. You shouldn't hold yourself back in coaching. Not in sessions. Not in conversations. Not in your business. And if you're shy? Good. Irina and I are social skills experts. We help shy coaches approach people. We help you get better at talking to everyone — not just clients. Your friends. Your family. The person at the coffee shop. Not a side effect of the program. The program.</p>
    <p class="standout">Slow down. It's not a race. It never was.</p>
    <p>Your coaching life doesn't have to be a burden. It can be the best part of your day. Most coaches move too fast. They meet someone at a coffee shop and try to coach them by the second sentence. They skip the trust. They skip the connection. They jump straight to "I can help you with that" before the other person even feels safe. They rush to sign clients. They rush through sessions. They rush to get results so they can prove this is working. And all that rushing makes it heavy. We slow coaches down.</p>
    <p class="big-green">Lighthearted. That's what we're building here.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<div class="container"><div class="divider-full"></div></div>

<!-- THE TWO MOVES -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Two Moves</h2>
    <p>There are only two moves as a coach. You're either asking a question or you're expressing yourself. That's it. Get good at those two things and everything else falls into place.</p>
    <p><span class="text-gold bold">Asking questions:</span> when you're with someone — ask them about who they are. Not who they think you want them to be. Who they are. Ask so many questions that the act falls apart. People lie to themselves about how much they want this. They say "maybe coaching isn't for me" and "I should probably get a real job" and "who am I to charge people for this." They talk themselves out of it before anyone else gets the chance to. Your job is to ask enough questions that the real person shows up. Where coaching starts. Where connection starts.</p>
    <p class="italic text-dim" style="text-align:center; padding: 20px 0;">Everything else is just small talk in a costume.</p>
    <p><span class="text-gold bold">Expressing yourself:</span> say what you see. Say what you feel. Say the thing you're afraid to say. Not a script. Not a coaching question you read in a book. You — the person — saying something honest to another person. That's what makes people trust you. That's what makes people hire you. Not your credentials. Not your website. You, being honest out loud.</p>
    <p>Want to know if someone is interested in coaching? It's not a mystery. People tell you when they want help. They lean in. They ask follow-up questions. They say "how does that work?" They keep the conversation going when they could have walked away. You just have to know what to listen for.</p>
    <p class="standout">But you have to take the lead.</p>
    <p>Most coaches wait. They're on their phone scrolling through nothing. Not working. Not reaching out. Not even thinking about coaching. Just... scrolling.</p>
    <p class="gremlin-text" style="text-align:center; padding: 10px 0; font-size: 1.15rem;">Because distractions feel safer than solutions.</p>
    <p>Lead the conversation. Lead the session. Lead the relationship. Your clients hired you because they need someone willing to go where they won't go alone.</p>
    <p class="text-gold bold" style="text-align:center; padding: 20px 0; font-size: 1.1rem;">If you're waiting for them to lead, who's coaching who?</p>
    <p><span class="text-gold bold">Inviting.</span> Not pitching. Not selling. Inviting.</p>
    <p>An invitation doesn't feel needy. It sounds like "I think I could help you with that — want to talk about it?" It sounds like "I'm starting something in April and you came to mind." A person who believes in what they do and isn't afraid to say so. You practice this until you stop rehearsing it in the shower and start saying it to actual humans.</p>
    <p><span class="text-gold bold">Three skills.</span> Most programs teach one. Maybe two.</p>
    <p>Coaching skills, business skills, and people skills. This one teaches all three. And then gives you six months to practice them while two coaches watch your back.</p>
    <p>Stop wasting your chances with people who want help. They're right in front of you. They're telling you their problems. They're asking you questions. And you're freezing, or changing the subject, or waiting for a better moment that never comes.</p>
    <p class="standout">Follow the values. The Gremlin gets quieter.</p>
    <p>You get values to follow. Not rules. Values. And when you follow those values — when you practice being light, being curious, being brave, showing up — you become the coach you've been pretending you're not ready to be.</p>

<!-- THE STUFF NOBODY TEACHES YOU -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Stuff Nobody Teaches You</h2>
    <p>What do you talk about when you get on a call with someone? Not a sales pitch — a real conversation. You talk about them. You ask what they want and what keeps getting in the way. You ask what they've tried and why it didn't work. You ask what scares them. You ask until you understand who they are. And then — if coaching makes sense — you say so. If it doesn't, you say that too. Two people talking where one of them happens to be a coach.</p>
    <p class="standout">Everyone has walls up. That's where you come in.</p>
    <p>Your job is to be so honest and so patient that the walls come down on their own. And they will. If you let them.</p>
    <p>But you can't do any of this sitting on your couch waiting for clients to find you. They won't. Take charge. Reach out to people. Start conversations. Follow up with the ones you already talked to. Make offers to the ones who are ready. The coach with people in their DMs who already said "tell me more" — people they haven't replied to in weeks? That coach isn't bad at marketing. They're bad at replying. Coaches who move — even scared, even messy, even before they feel ready — build practices.</p>
    <p class="big-quote-gold">So move.</p>
    <p><span class="text-gold bold">The vibe.</span> You know the one.</p>
    <p>The vibe where people tell you things. Where they say the thing they haven't said to anyone. Where they skip the small talk and go straight to what matters. You can learn how to do that. You learn it by slowing down and paying attention. When you create that vibe, people start telling you what they need. Coaching starts there.</p>
    <p>You know you've created it when a prospect leaves you a 20-minute voicemail. Not a polite "hey, call me back." Twenty minutes of them telling you what's going on. What they're afraid of. What they want. What they've tried. They didn't plan to talk that long. They just felt safe enough to keep going. That's not an accident. That's a skill. And when someone leaves you a voicemail like that, they already hired you. They just haven't paid yet.</p>
    <p>And hey — coaches are allowed to start conversations too. You don't have to wait for someone to come to you. You don't need permission. You're a person. You can say hi. You can ask someone how they're doing. You can bring up what you do without it being weird. The only thing making it weird is the story you're telling yourself about it.</p>
    <p>We know about the fear. The big one. The one underneath all the other fears. <span class="gremlin-text">That someone will call you horrible. That they'll say you're a fraud. That they'll tell you to your face that you have no business coaching anyone.</span> That fear runs everything if you let it. It decides who you talk to, what you charge, how you show up, and whether you show up at all. We don't make that fear go away.</p>
    <p class="big-quote-gold">You coach anyway.</p>
    <p>And after six months of coaching anyway, the fear gets bored and finds someone else to bother.</p>
    <p>If what you're doing as a coach is working, keep doing it. But if it's not — change something. Change anything. Change your price. Change how you start sessions. Change who you talk to. Change what you say when someone asks what you do. Change how often you follow up. Coaches hold on to things that aren't working because changing feels like admitting failure. It's not failure. It's coaching.</p>
    <p class="gremlin-text" style="text-align:center; padding: 20px 0; font-size: 1.2rem;">You tell your clients to change all the time. Why won't you?</p>
    <p>And yes — you have to make time for your coaching practice. Blocked-off, phone-down, door-closed time. Not the leftover scraps after everything else. Not the 20 minutes before bed when you're too tired to think. Time where you pick up the phone, talk to a person, practice the stuff, and show up to calls like it matters. Six months of treating this thing like it matters. If coaching is your purpose — and it is — then treat it like one.</p>
    <p class="standout">Six months of treating this thing like it matters.</p>

<!-- WHAT COACHING ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What Coaching Actually Looks Like</h2>
    <p>Coaches don't want to ruffle feathers. That's the problem. They'd rather have a nice conversation where everyone feels comfortable and nothing changes than say the thing that might make someone squirm. You can want people to relax around you and still not be attached to whether they do. Say what needs to be said. Let them have whatever reaction they're going to have. That's their business.</p>
    <p>People hide things when they think you're going to judge them. Or get mad at them. Clients do it. Prospects do it. Everyone does it. They tell you the version of the story that makes them look good. They leave out the embarrassing part. They skip the thing they're ashamed of. And you can't coach somebody on the stuff they're hiding from you. So you have to make it safe enough that they stop hiding. Not by being soft. By being the kind of person who doesn't flinch.</p>
    <p>Which means you have to learn to not judge your clients. And not get angry with them. Even when they do the thing you told them not to do. Even when they lie to you. Even when they ghost you for two weeks and come back like nothing happened. Your reaction is the game. If they think you're disappointed in them, they'll hide more. If they think you're mad, they'll shut down. Stay curious. Stay light. That's how people open up.</p>
    <p>But don't confuse being light with being their buddy. Coaches put themselves in the friend zone when they don't bring in any professionalism. No structure. No boundaries. No clear start or end to the session. Just two friends talking. Your friend who owns a bakery — you buy brownies from her. Your friend who's a massage therapist — you book appointments. You pay them because they created something separate from the friendship. Something with a time, a place, and a price. If your coaching looks exactly like hanging out, nobody knows when to pay you. Create the distinction and people will.</p>
    <p class="big-quote-gold">You're going to learn to pry.</p>
    <p>Coaches are too polite. They walk on eggshells with their clients. They ask one question and accept the first answer. But the first answer is almost never the truth. The truth is three questions deeper.</p>
    <p class="standout">Prying isn't rude. Prying is care.</p>
    <p>It means you're not willing to let someone get away with the watered-down version of their life. You push — with love — until the truth shows up.</p>
    <p>But you also learn when to let up. Sometimes people need a second. They just said something big and they need to breathe. So you let them breathe. You crack a joke. You say "that was a lot, huh." And then — when they're ready — you go back in. Other times they're dodging and you know it. That's when you push back. Not mean. Just honest. "I don't think that's what's going on. What's really going on?" Knowing when to push and when to back off — that's the part nobody teaches you. We do.</p>
    <p class="italic text-dim" style="text-align:center; padding: 20px 0;">That's the job. The rest is just getting in the room.</p>
    <p>Talk to people like a human. Not like a coach who read a book about connecting. Look them in the eye. Listen to what they're saying. Respond to what they mean, not just what they said. Laugh when something's funny. Be quiet when something's heavy. Let people breathe. Let people think. Let people feel something before you jump in with a coaching question.</p>
    <p class="standout">You won't find it in a definition. You'll find it in the room.</p>
    <p>What is a good coach? A good coach treats every single person like they are their best friend. Not nice-nice. Not professional-warm. Actually caring. About the person in front of you. About what they want. About what's stopping them. About their life. When you treat someone like your best friend, you tell them the truth. You root for them. You don't let them off the hook. You remember what they said last week. You ask how that thing went.</p>
    <p>That's a good coach. And you already are one. You just haven't let yourself act like it yet.</p>
    <p>Be honest. And when they're honest back — tell them. "That took guts to say." "I'm glad you told me that." "The realest thing you've said in three sessions."</p>
    <p class="big-quote-gold">You go first. That's it.</p>
    <p>You go first. They open up. You go deeper. They go deeper. And before you know it you're in a conversation that changes somebody's life. Practice that until you stop thinking about it.</p>

<!-- WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU JOIN -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What Happens After You Join</h2>
    <p>You get added to the private community. You introduce yourself. You read the Bartender Method if you haven't already. April 17th you show up to the first call and meet everyone. We teach the first method. You practice it that week. You come back to office hours and tell us what happened. That's it. That's how it starts. No overwhelm. No 47 modules to catch up on. Just a call, a method, and a group of people doing the same thing.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<div class="container"><div class="divider-full"></div></div>

<!-- THE METHODS -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>The Methods</h2>
    <h3>Each one stole from a different character. On purpose.</h3>
    <p>Each month, we teach one method. Each method is named after a character — from a movie, a TV show, or in one case, a real woman who teaches kindergarten in Sedona. Because stories stick better than frameworks. And characters are easier to remember than acronyms.</p>
    <br>

```
<div class="method-card">
  <div class="method-month">Month 1 • April</div>
  <div class="method-name">The Bartender Method</div>
  <p>You're coaching people in drive-throughs. At Applebee's. On the phone while your kids are screaming. You say yes to everything, charge nothing, and wonder why no one takes you seriously. This method is about what to STOP doing. Because you've been running your coaching practice like a sad bartender — cleaning up everyone's mess and going home with nothing to show for it.</p>
</div>

<div class="method-card">
  <div class="method-month">Month 2 • May</div>
  <div class="method-name">The Columbo Method</div>
  <p>You rehearse what you're going to say for 20 minutes and then don't send the message. You treat every conversation like a job interview where you're the one being judged. Columbo never pitched. He asked one dumb question, then another, then said "just one more thing" — and people told him everything. This is how you connect with humans without performing, pitching, or running to your car.</p>
</div>

<div class="method-card">
  <div class="method-month">Month 3 • June</div>
  <div class="method-name">The Coach Carter Method</div>
  <p>Someone said yes and now you have no idea what to do. What day do you meet? How long? What happens when it gets weird? What do you say in the first session? What do you do when you've become their therapist, their friend, and their emotional support animal all at once? Carter locked the gym doors because the standards mattered more than the winning. This is the container nobody taught you to build.</p>
</div>

<div class="method-card">
  <div class="method-month">Month 4 • July</div>
  <div class="method-name">The Miss Julie Method</div>
  <p>Picture a kindergarten teacher who never raised her voice. She baked bread with five-year-olds every Thursday. She held the room in the palm of her hand by doing less, not more. Your practice has seasons. You can't force growth in winter. This is how you stop choking your calendar and start trusting the rhythm.</p>
</div>

<div class="method-card">
  <div class="method-month">Month 5 • August</div>
  <div class="method-name">The Coach Taylor Method</div>
  <p>Your client is circling the same story for the third week in a row. You know exactly what needs to be said. And you won't say it — because you're afraid they'll leave. Clear eyes, full hearts. This is how you say the hard thing, believe in someone who doesn't believe in themselves yet, and coach like it actually matters.</p>
</div>

<div class="method-card">
  <div class="method-month">Month 6 • September</div>
  <div class="method-name">The Mr. Miyagi Method</div>
  <p>Daniel wanted to learn karate. Miyagi had him wax cars and paint fences. Felt pointless. Was the entire training. You're chasing shiny tactics when the three boring things you keep skipping ARE the work. This is where you stop overthinking, trust the practice, and let the system click.</p>

    <h2>This Might Scare You Off. Good.</h2>
    <p>We want people in this group who are going to do something. About their coaching. About their business. About the voice in their head that keeps saying "not yet."</p>
    <p>If you're looking for someone to hand you a business plan, this will frustrate you. We teach methods, not rules. You have to bring the courage.</p>
    <p>If your business feels heavy and you want it to stay heavy, we can't help you. Lighthearted is the point. It's a practice, and we practice it together.</p>
    <p>If you want coaching 24/7 — in the group, in the DMs, between sessions — that's the thing we're going to help you stop doing. Coaching happens on the calls and in the sessions. The rest of your life is just your life. Learn that and you'll stop exhausting yourself.</p>

<!-- THIS IS FOR YOU IF -->

<section class="section-gap">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>This Is For You If:</h2>
    <p>You know coaching is your thing. Maybe your business is great. Maybe it sucks. Either way, you want to be around people who take this seriously enough to make it lighthearted.</p>
    <p>You want a community of coaches who are all working on the same stuff — getting clients, running sessions, building practices — under the same umbrella. The lighthearted one.</p>
    <div class="grad-box" style="font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: 500; font-size: clamp(1.1rem, 3vw, 1.3rem); line-height: 1.7; text-align: left;">You can't do this alone. You need people who remind you what you're building when the Gremlin says quit. You need someone to say "that conversation you're avoiding? That's the one that gets you a client." You need to watch other coaches stumble through the same stuff and come out the other side laughing. You need people who cheer when you make an offer and shrug when someone says no.</div>
    <p>That's what this group becomes. A trust and support system. Not just for your business — for you. You learn to build that with the people in this room, and then you learn to build it everywhere else. With your clients. With your friends. With the people you haven't met yet. Getting people to trust you — and trusting them back — that's the thing underneath everything else we teach.</p>
    <p>You want to do this with other people. People who are also figuring this out. People you can text at 9pm and say "I just invited someone to a session and I didn't die."</p>

    <h2>Questions You're Asking</h2>

```
<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"I've done group programs before and they were a waste of money."</div>
  <p class="faq-a">This one has two coaches who show up every week. Plus four private calls. It's not a course with a Facebook group stapled on. We're in the room with you.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"I can't afford this right now."</div>
  <p class="faq-a">One client paying you $500/month covers the early bird price before the program is half over. And you've still got months of coaching left after that.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"What if I'm too new to coaching?"</div>
  <p class="faq-a">If you've coached even one person — paid or free — you're ready. The Bartender Method starts with what to STOP doing. You can't be too new for that.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"What if I'm too experienced for this?"</div>
  <p class="faq-a">If you have all the clients you want and your practice runs with joy, skip this. But if you've been coaching for years and still dread the business side? That's exactly who this is for.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"Is the full Lighthearted Coach Training included?"</div>
  <p class="faq-a">No. The training is separate ($397) and goes deeper into the ideas behind all of this. This program teaches the six methods. Some people do both. Neither requires the other.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"Is this one of those 'push their emotional triggers' things?"</div>
  <p class="faq-a">No. We don't teach you to trick people into buying coaching. No scripts. No closing tricks. No "find out where it hurts and press harder." You learn to have honest conversations, ask good questions, and make offers without being weird about it. If that sounds boring, this isn't for you. If that sounds like a relief, it is.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"I already have all these books and courses I haven't finished."</div>
  <p class="faq-a">A book doesn't notice when you stop reading. A course doesn't care if you skip module 4. This does. You show up twice a month. People know your name. Your coaches notice when you go quiet. You can't put this on a shelf and feel good about owning it. You have to do it.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"What if it doesn't work for me?"</div>
  <p class="faq-a">If you show up, do the work, talk to people, and practice the methods for six months — something will change. We can't promise you ten clients by September. We can promise you won't be the same coach you are right now. That's not a guarantee. That's math.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-q">"What days/times are the calls?"</div>
  <p class="faq-a">Two Fridays per month, starting April 17th. One Friday is the masterclass. One Friday is office hours. We'll pick times that work for the group. Calls are recorded if you miss one.</p>
